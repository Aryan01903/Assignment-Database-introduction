Database :- A database is an organized way to store and manage data using software called a DBMS. It makes data easy to access, update, and retrieve.
need of database :- Without a database, managing large or connected data (like in spreadsheets) can cause duplication, errors, and inefficiency.
Example:
In a school system:
- Without a Database: Student info across multiple files can become inconsistent and hard to query.
- With a Database: All data (students, courses, etc.) is stored in tables, linked for consistency. Updates and queries are faster and more reliable.
Databases ensure efficiency, accuracy, and simplicity.
