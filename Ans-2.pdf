A file-based storage system uses files and folders to store, organize, and manage data on storage devices. Each application manages its own set of files, leading to independent data handling.

Major Challenges:
- Data Redundancy:
Multiple files may store the same data, wasting storage and causing inconsistency during updates.
- Data Inconsistency:
Changes in one file may not reflect in others, leading to mismatched or outdated data.
- Limited Querying:
Retrieving specific information requires manual searching, making it inefficient for large data sets.
- Poor Security:
Files lack centralized control, making sensitive data more vulnerable.
- Scalability Issues:
Managing large volumes of files becomes chaotic and error-prone.

File-based systems are simple but unsuitable for handling complex or interconnected data.
