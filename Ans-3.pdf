A Database Management System (DBMS) is software used to create, manage, and manipulate databases. It provides tools to store, retrieve, update, and secure data efficiently, using a structured approach.
Need for DBMS:
- Data Redundancy and Inconsistency:
Reduces duplicate data and ensures consistency across all records.
- Efficient Data Access:
Enables quick retrieval of specific data using queries.
- Data Security:
Protects data with access controls and permissions.
- Concurrent Access:
Allows multiple users to access and update data simultaneously without conflict.
- Data Integrity:
Maintains accuracy and reliability of data through constraints.
A DBMS solves the inefficiencies and risks of traditional file-based systems, making data handling more robust and scalable.
