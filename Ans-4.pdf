Challenges of File-Based Storage Tackled by DBMS:- 
- Data Redundancy:
DBMS eliminates duplication by centralizing data storage.
- Data Inconsistency:
Ensures data updates are consistent across the system through constraints and relationships.
- Data Retrieval:
DBMS provides query languages like SQL for efficient data retrieval.
- Concurrent Access:
Manages simultaneous access by multiple users with transaction control mechanisms.
- Data Security:
Offers robust security features like user authentication and role-based access.
