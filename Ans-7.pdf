Three-Schema Architecture
Internal Schema:

- Describes physical storage (e.g., file structures, indexing).
- Advantage: Hides physical details, optimizing performance.
Conceptual Schema:
- Centralized view of the entire database structure.
- Advantage: Abstracts storage specifics, ensuring data integrity and independence.
External Schema:
- User-specific views of the data (e.g., reports, UI interfaces).
- Advantage: Provides customization for different user needs.
Advantages of Three-Schema Architecture:
- Ensures data abstraction and independence.
- Separates user views from physical storage.
- Simplifies database design and maintenance.
